  <p class="mb-6">
    I developed this web application after noticing how difficult it can be to
    find out what clothes people are wearing in photos online. Using Google's
    image search is often inaccurate and gives similar looking clothing but not
    the exact piece of clothing, while asking on forums related to the celebrity
    often leads to little to no helpful replies. Building a platform that
    attracts users interested in clothing and with expertise or more knowledge
    about styles that a celebrity often wears would have great potential to
    solve this problem.

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-rose-200 mb-2">Technical Challenges</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    One major technical challenge I had while setting up my application
    architecture was how to store user uploaded images. I had never stored user
    uploaded images in an application before, so I did some research on my
    options. After looking through services like Supabase's storage, AWS S3,
    Cloudinary, and BackBlaze B2, I decided on Cloudinary for this project.
    Cloudinary had an easy-to-use API for uploading and delivering images,
    options to deliver images through a CDN to improve performance, and offered
    transformations to manipulate images which could come in handy in the
    future. They also had a solid free tier for my usage so I gave it a go, and
    it seems to be working great so far.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-rose-200 mb-2">Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    My main takeaway from this project is the benefit of using TypeScript with
    other typesafe developer tools when developing web applications. Prior to
    working on this project, I stayed away from TypeScript because I thought
    there would be little benefit in its use for my small projects. After
    countless recommendations from reputable discussions online, I decided to
    give it a go. The initial setup and usage of types was a bit daunting and
    slow, but once I got accustomed to the changes from JavaScript, my
    development process was much smoother and I was able to catch errors quicker
    than I would in a JavaScript project. I plan on migrating my past projects
    to TypeScript, and starting future projects with a typesafe language.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-rose-200 mb-2">Next Steps</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I plan on implementing features like a voting and reputation system on
    clothing suggestions, content moderation, and generating statistics from
    data about celebrities like most their worn brand or average price of
    clothing. I also want to optimize for performance and decide where in my web
    application I can use server-side rendering or static site generation to
    improve the user experience.
